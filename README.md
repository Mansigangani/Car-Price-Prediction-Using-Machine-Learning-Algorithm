# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
This project implements a car price prediction model using Machine Learning algorithms. The model predicts car prices based on various features, such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant factors. The approach leverages Linear Regression for the price prediction task. The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values and applying encoding techniques for categorical data.

data.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model contains various car-related features such as:
Make
Model
Year of Manufacture
Mileage
Fuel type
Transmission
And more...

Steps followed in the project:
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values in the dataset.
Applied One-Hot Encoding (OHE) and Label Encoding for categorical columns.
Normalized the data where needed.
Train-Test Split:
Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets to evaluate model performance.
Model Selection:
Implemented the Linear Regression model to predict car prices.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model using the R² score (coefficient of determination) to assess the model's performance.
Training R² Score: 0.010
Testing R² Score: -0.014
A low R² score indicates the model's poor performance and that it might not be ideal for this particular dataset.

Assumptions of Linear Regression:

Checked for the key assumptions of linear regression, such as:
Linearity
Homoscedasticity
Independence of errors
Normality of errors
These checks were performed to ensure the appropriateness of Linear Regression for this dataset.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

Results and Discussion
The model's performance with Linear Regression yielded poor results with low R² scores. This suggests that more advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) or additional feature engineering might be needed for better performance.
Further steps could include hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and trying different machine learning algorithms to improve the predictive accuracy.

Future Improvements
Experiment with different algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost to improve model performance.
Feature engineering to include interaction terms or non-linear transformations of features.
Tune the model using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search for optimal parameters.
Investigate other methods for handling missing values or outliers in the dataset.
